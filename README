JIGSAW is a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system that attempts to disambiguate all words in a text by exploiting WordNet senses.
The main assumption is that a speciﬁc strategy for each Part-Of-Speech (POS) is better than a single strategy.

In order to run JIGSAW, you must execute the script jigsaw.sh in the ./bin directory. The script requires the following parameters:

-cf <configuration file>, the configuration file is available in /resources/jigsaw.properties

-i <input file>, the file which contains the text that will be disambiguated

-o <output file>, the file in which you want to save the output. This parameter is optional, the standard output is used if you omit it

-m tokenized|tagged, the format of the input text. tokenized, one token per line. tagged, one token per line with pos-tag. This parameter 
is optional, non-tokenized text is used if you omit it

*CONFIGURATION FILE

This file contains options about JIGSAW. One option per line. The option is in the following format <option>=<value>. Information about options are reported
into the configuration file: ./resources/jigsaw.properties

*INPUT FILE

You can use three different formats:

-non-tokenized text

-tokenized text: one token per line

-tagged: one token per line with pos-tag in the following format: word.postag. The postag is a character which indicates the part-of-speech of the word.
	 You can use five types of pos-tag: n for nouns, v for verbs, a for adjectives, r for adverbs and o for other part-of speech tags.

*OUTPUT FILE
The output reports one token per line. Each token is followed by the stem, part-of-speech, lemma and the WSD output.

*WORDNET
JIGSAW relies on WordNet as knowledge base. You can download WordNet from http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/.
In order to use WordNet, you must configure the file ./resources/wn_file_properties.xml. In particular you must change the following line:

<param name="dictionary_path" value="/home/user/WordNet/3.0/dict/"/>

Inser into the attribute value the directory in which the WordNet dictionary is installed.

*EXAMPLES
The test directory contains some input/output file in different formats. Some command line examples are reported:

./jigsaw.sh -cf ../resources/jigsaw.properties -i ../test/non-tokenized

./jigsaw.sh -cf ../resources/jigsaw.properties -i ../test/tokenized -m tokenized

./jigsaw.sh -cf ../resources/jigsaw.properties -i ../test/tagged -m tagged
